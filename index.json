To achieve this, developers need a robust mechanism to configure apps remotely without frequent updates. Firebase RemoteConfig is a powerful tool offered by Google Firebase. It enables developers to dynamically update app settings, content, and feature flags from a centralized console, allowing them to deliver a personalized and tailored experience to the users.\nWhat is Firebase RemoteConfig? Firebase RemoteConfig is a cloud-based service that allows developers to change the behavior and appearance of their mobile applications without requiring users to update their apps. It provides a simple and efficient way to manage configurable parameters such as feature flags, strings, numbers, and even remote JSON files. With RemoteConfig, developers can fine-tune their app’s behavior, perform A/B testing, and target specific user segments based on dynamic conditions.\nBenefits of Using RemoteConfig: 2.1 Real-time Configuration Updates: Firebase RemoteConfig enables developers to update app configurations in real time, eliminating the need for app updates. This capability empowers developers to react swiftly to changing requirements, fix bugs, and introduce new features without disrupting the user experience.\n2.2 Personalization and A/B Testing: With RemoteConfig, developers can define configurations for specific user segments or conduct A/B tests to evaluate the impact of various settings on user engagement and conversion rates. This allows for data-driven decision-making and personalized experiences tailored to each user.\n2.3 Gradual Rollouts and Phased Feature Launches: RemoteConfig supports gradual rollouts of new features by allowing developers to target a subset of users with specific configurations. By releasing features incrementally, developers can gather feedback, monitor performance, and ensure a smooth rollout for all users.\n2.4 Simplified Maintenance: By centralizing configuration management in a web-based console, RemoteConfig simplifies the maintenance process. Developers can modify configurations, set default values, and monitor the usage and impact of different settings, all from a single location.\nWorking with RemoteConfig: 3.1 Configuration Setup: Developers define configuration parameters, their default values, and any associated conditions within the Firebase console. These parameters are stored in the Firebase backend and can be easily updated without requiring app updates.\n3.2 Fetching and Applying Configurations: The mobile app fetches the latest configurations from the Firebase backend during runtime. RemoteConfig provides a simple API to fetch and apply configurations within the app, ensuring that the app’s behavior adapts to the latest settings.\n3.3 Conditions and Targeting: RemoteConfig supports conditional configurations based on various criteria such as app version, language, country, user properties, or custom conditions defined by developers.

They are self-contained blocks of functionality.\nClosures are commonly used in Swift to perform tasks like sorting and filtering collections and for handling asynchronous tasks.\nSyntax:\nA closure is defined using curly braces { } and can take in one or more arguments, and returns a value. Here’s a basic syntax of a closure:\n{ (params) -\u0026gt; return type in // Statement } params — any value passed to the closure returnType — specifies the type of value returned by the closure in (optional) — used to separate parameters/returnType from the closure body Statement — code to be executed. Closures need not have the first 3 always. Find the below examples supporting the statement.\nvar sayHi = { print(\u0026#34;Hey!\u0026#34;) } // call the closure sayHi() // output is Hey! This example of closure prints a string. It doesn’t require any parameters. It doesn’t return anything. It just has a single line of code to execute.\nNow let us see other examples of closure where we have either a parameter or a return type.\nlet sayHi = { (name: String) in print(\u0026#34;Hey!, \\(name).\u0026#34;) } // closure call sayHi(\u0026#34;Mahi\u0026#34;) // output is Hey!, Mahi let taskCompleted = { ()-\u0026gt; String in return \u0026#34;Bravo You Are Done!\u0026#34; } // closure call print(taskCompleted()) // output is Bravo You Are Done! Hope you have understood what is closure. How to write closure in Swift. Now let us move to the usage of closure in Swift.\nNow let us consider a block of code that needs to be executed after the method has completed its task. Let us have a look below for example.\nfunc add(first: Int, second: Int, completion: (Int) -\u0026gt; String) { let sum = first + second print(completion(sum)) } add(first: 4, second: 56) { result in return \u0026#34;result is \\(result)\u0026#34; } // output is result is 60 add(first: 4, second: 56) { result in return \u0026#34;sum is \\(result)\u0026#34; } // output is sum is 60 Here method add takes 2 integers and 1 closure as arguments. It performs the sum of 2 numbers. After the addition is done it calls the closure to print the result according to the code written in the closure.\nHere, the first method call defines the closure to return the string “result is 60” while the second return the string “sum is 60”. So we can conclude that closure also gives the power to the method to execute a different set of code depending on where it is called.\n","tags":["Swift"],"title":"Closures: Swift"},{"categories":["Blog"],"date":"August 22, 2022","permalink":"https://mahigarg.github.io/blogs/for-loop-with-where-clause-swift/","section":"blogs","summary":"For loop is an inevitable part of any programming language. It iterates over every element of the collection type data including array, set, and dictionary, and does the operation as per the code.\nLet us see an example of the same.

But as a developer, we can’t use the same to display to users.\nImagine we have a dashboard application that displays monthly tax on an employee\u0026rsquo;s salary. And it is coming as 630.6152. This doesn’t look good at all to say the same. It will be better to show it like 630.62 or 630.61 i.e., rounding it to n Decimal Digit.\nLet us take a look at how this can be done.\nIf we say round up to n Decimal Digits where n equals 2. Then we need to follow the below steps\nMultiply it by 100 (10^n) Use round, floor, or ceil to remove the extra digits Divide by 100 (10^n) Round to n digits using the round function //after calculation tax = 630.6152 //multiply with 100 var result = tax * 100 //63061.52 //Using round to remove extra digit roundresult = round(result) //63062 //divide by 100 result = result/ 100 print (result) //630.62 print(evenNumbers) Here tax 630.6152 is rounded to 630.62 as the third decimal digit is 5.\nLet us consider example 437.1932. Here 3 is the third decimal digit.\n//after calculation tax = 437.1932 //multiply with 100 var result = tax * 100 //43719.32 //Using round to remove extra digit roundresult = round(result) //43719 //divide by 100 result = result/ 100 print (result) //437.19 On comparing the result of both the example, we can see the result depends on the decimal digits we have. If the third digit is between 1 to 4, then it will keep the existing previous results (437.1932 -\u0026gt; 437.19) but in the case of digits between 5–9, it increases the last digit (630.6152 -\u0026gt; 630.61).\nNow let us see how our output will be impacted if we use the floor or ceil function instead of round.\nRound to n digits using the floor function Considering the same example here. Tax after calculation equals 630.6152.\n//after calculation tax = 630.6152 //multiply with 100 var result = tax * 100 //63061.52 //Using floor to remove extra digit floorResult = floor(result) //63061 //divide by 100 floorResult = floorResult / 100 print (floorResult) //630.61 Here, we saw floor will step down the result irrespective of the digit we have at the third position, be it 1 or 9 it will always take you to the nearest smallest number.\nRound to n digits using the ceil function Here, let us alter our example to 630.6122 and see how our results vary.\n//after calculation tax = 630.6122 //multiply with 100 var result = tax * 100 //63061.22 //Using ceil to remove extra digit ceilResult = ceil(result) //63062 //divide by 100 ceilResult = ceilResult / 100 print (ceilResult) //630.62 Here, we saw ceil will step up the result irrespective of the digit we have at the third position, be it anything between 1 to 9 it will always take you to the nearest largest number.\n","tags":["Swift"],"title":"Round up to n Decimal Digit: Swift"},{"categories":["Blog"],"date":"May 30, 2022","permalink":"https://mahigarg.github.io/blogs/map-operator-swift/","section":"blogs","summary":"The collection is something which is used by almost everyone.

Map operator is one of them. Let’s try to understand the Map operator in detail.\nWhat is Map operator? Map operator is used to creating a new collection object by iterating over the existing collection object and applying some transformation to it.\nThe transformation that needs to be applied, is passed as a higher-order function named transform to the map function.\nSince the map operator is present in Iterator, it can be used with all three collections ie Array, Set, and Dictionary.\n/// Returns an array containing the results of mapping the given closure over the sequence\u0026#39;s elements. /// - Parameter transform: A mapping closure. `transform` accepts an /// element of this sequence as its parameter and returns a transformed value of the same or of a different type. /// - Returns: An array containing the transformed elements of this sequence. @inlinable public func map\u0026lt;T\u0026gt;(_ transform: (Element) throws -\u0026gt; T) rethrows -\u0026gt; [T] Keep in mind, that this map function never holds the exceptions but it throws them to the caller. If there are any chances of any kind of exception at runtime, we need to wrap this inside a try-catch block.\nMap with Array map operator can be used over an Array to apply the transformation on its elements and return the new Array. It can be used with a named parameter or using $0.\nlet array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] let mappedArray = array.map { item in //this will convert all the elements to its square item * item } //or let mappedArray = array.map { //this will convert all the elements to its square $0 * $0 } print(mappedArray) It can also be used with enumerated for positional-based access.\nlet array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] let mappedArray = array.enumerated().map { index, item in //this will convert all the elements to its square item * item } //or let mappedArray = arrayenumerated.map { //this will convert all the elements to its square $1 * $1 } print(mappedArray) Map with Set Similar to Array, the map operator can be used along with a Set to iterate over its elements, apply some transformation on its elements and return the new Set.

Additionally, it will tell you how to configure the remoteConfig Parameter and fetch and Apply the configuration to your app.\nStep 1: Setting Up Firebase RemoteConfig: 1.1 Create a Firebase Project: Start by creating a Firebase project through the Firebase console. Follow the provided instructions to set up your project, including adding the necessary dependencies to your app.\n1.2 Enable RemoteConfig: In the Firebase console, navigate to the RemoteConfig section and enable it for your project. This will allow you to define and manage remote configurations for your app.\nStep 2: Configuring Remote Parameters: 2.1 Define Parameters: Within the RemoteConfig section of the Firebase console, define the parameters you want to configure remotely. These parameters can include strings, booleans, numbers, or JSON objects. Set default values for each parameter to ensure that your app has fallback values in case the remote configurations are not yet fetched.\n2.2 Add Conditions (Optional): To target specific user segments or conditions, you can add conditions to your parameters. For example, you can define a condition based on the user’s country, app version, or any other custom criteria. This allows you to tailor the configurations for different user segments.\nStep 3: Fetching and Applying Configurations: 3.1 Initialize RemoteConfig: In your app’s code, initialize the RemoteConfig instance by obtaining a reference to it from the Firebase SDK. This allows you to interact with the RemoteConfig service.\n3.2 Fetch Configurations: To fetch the remote configurations, call the fetch() method on the RemoteConfig instance. You can specify a cache expiration duration to control how frequently the configurations should be refreshed. Firebase provides options for using a minimum fetch interval or manual fetch.\n3.3 Apply Configurations: After fetching the configurations, call the activate() method to apply the fetched configurations to your app. This ensures that the app\u0026rsquo;s behavior aligns with the remote settings.\nStep 4: Remote Configuration Updates: 4.1 Modify Configurations: To update the configurations remotely, make changes within the Firebase console. You can modify parameter values, add new parameters, or adjust conditions.\n4.2 Publish Configurations: After making the necessary changes, publish the configurations from the Firebase console. Publishing makes the updated configurations available to your app during the next fetch.\nStep 5: Testing and Monitoring: 5.1 Test Configurations: Before deploying the configurations to all users, test them thoroughly to ensure they function as expected. Consider creating a test environment or using Firebase’s remote conditions to target a small group of users for testing purposes.\n5.2 Monitor Performance: Leverage Firebase Analytics to track the impact of configuration changes on user behavior, engagement, and other relevant metrics. This helps you understand the effectiveness of your configurations and make data-driven decisions for optimization.\n","tags":["Firebase"],"title":"Setup Firebase RemoteConfig"},{"categories":["Blog"],"date":"May 29, 2022","permalink":"https://mahigarg.github.io/blogs/0-1-n-in-swift/","section":"blogs","summary":"In order to use any parameter in a closure or a higher-order function, we need to name the parameter inside the closure or higher-order function.\nThe syntax looks like the below.\nlet array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] let evenNumbers = array.filter { item in item % 2 == 0 } print(evenNumbers) This filter function takes a single argument which is another function that is of (Int) -\u0026gt; Bool type.

We want to break the inner as well as out loop on some condition.\nfor i in 0...5 { for j in 0...5 { print (i + j) //break from outer loop if i + j == 5 } } Break statement can help here but break statement only works for immediate loop.\nfor i in 0...5 { for j in 0...5 { print (i + j) //break from outer loop if i + j == 5 if (i + j == 5) { break } } } It will just break the inner loop but not the outer loop.\nThere is one way where we can use a boolean flag and set it to true when we found the first condition true and every time we check inside the outer loop for that flag.\nThere is another way where we can move this to a function and return from the function when the first time condition met.\nBut there is a simpler way in swift which can help us here. we can name the loops as per the requirement and can break them using the name of the loop as below.\nouterLoop: for i in 0...5 { innerLoop: for j in 0...5 { print (i + j) //break from outer loop if i + j == 5 if (i + j == 5) { break outerLoop } } } We can skip the label if we are not going to use it inside.\nThese label statement can be used with if statement, for-loop, while-loop, repeat and switch statement which makes our life super easy.\n","tags":["Swift"],"title":"Labeled Statement : Swift"},{"categories":null,"date":"January 1, 0001","permalink":"https://mahigarg.github.io/portfolio/explore/","section":"portfolio","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Explore"},{"categories":null,"date":"January 1, 0001","permalink":"https://mahigarg.github.io/portfolio/gooir/","section":"portfolio","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Gooir"},{"categories":null,"date":"January 1, 0001","permalink":"https://mahigarg.github.io/portfolio/kana/","section":"portfolio","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Kana"},{"categories":null,"date":"January 1, 0001","permalink":"https://mahigarg.github.io/portfolio/mozar/","section":"portfolio","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Mozar"},{"categories":null,"date":"January 1, 0001","permalink":"https://mahigarg.github.io/portfolio/stay-fit/","section":"portfolio","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Stay Fit"},{"categories":null,"date":"January 1, 0001","permalink":"https://mahigarg.github.io/portfolio/zorro/","section":"portfolio","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Zorro"}]
